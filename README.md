# SageMaker-dog-cat-detector

It is a fun project that utilzes the AWS SageMaker Machine Learning Service to work out a image classifier f
or Dog Or Cat.  It is implemented based on SageMaker built-in algorithm - Image Classification Algorithm wit
h pre-trained model. The pre-trained model is trained from Image-Net dataset.  We just do transfer learning
to further fine tune the model.
